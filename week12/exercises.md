# Exercise 14: React meets Express - part II

_Goal: Connect the "HeapOverrun" React Client and the API Server._

Starting from the React application and the API Server in Express available in the GitHub repository and developed in Exercise 13, continue integrating the two.

In particular, perform all the operations to add/edit an answer and to vote on it. 

Optionally, implement the missing CRUD operations for the questions and the answers in both the server and the client.
